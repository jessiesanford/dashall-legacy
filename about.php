			<h3>What is DashAll?</h3>
			<p>
				DashAll is an urban delivery logistics platform (a mouthful, we know) founded in St. John's, Newfoundland that connects delivery drivers to customers. 
			</p>
			<hr />
			<h3>Wait, what does that mean exactly?</h3>
			<p>
				Well, with DashAll you now have the option of getting anything delivered, from anywhere (within reason of course).<br />
				This allows anyone to place an order for delivery from any restaurant or business in St. John's.
			</p>
			<hr />
			<h3>Who created this thing?</h3>
			<p>
				It was founded by two Memorial University students who were afflicted by things: <br />
				1. Disappointment by the lack of variety for deliverable meals.<br />
				2. An itch to create something that bounded their passion for technology and logistics alike.
